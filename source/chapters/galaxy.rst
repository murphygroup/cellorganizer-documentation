CellOrganizer on Galaxy+Bridges
===============================

Introduction
************
CellOrganizer is an open source system for using cellular microscope images to learn statistical models of the structure of cell components and of how those components are organized relative to each other. These generative models may then be used to synthesize new images in order to reflect what the model has learned. The model learning component of CellOrganizer allows for the user to capture variation amongst cells in a collection of images.

Essentially, CellOrganizer provides the tools for

* Learning generative models of cell organization directly from microscope images

* Storing and retrieving those generative models in XML files

* Synthesizing cell images (or other representations) from one or more models

For the duration of this tutorial, the user will be working with CellOrganizer on Galaxy+Bridges for training and synthesis from two- and three- dimensional models.

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform intended for data intensive biomedical research. This instance of Galaxy will seamlessly allow the user to create and implement workflows on CellOrganizer to create and analyze parametric and non-parametric models as well as their respective samples.
