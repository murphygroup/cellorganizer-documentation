Agenda
=======

1. Downloading Pre-Trained Model on Galaxy
2. Synthesizing synthetic images and SBML Instance from Model
3. Uploading and viewing your realistic geometry on CellBlender
4. Creating a Lotka-Volterra Simulation with your geometry

Questions
==========

* What do I need to run  CellOrganizer for Galaxy?
* How to create a history using CellOrganizer for Galaxy?
* How to import a pre-loaded model from CellOrganizer on my history?
* How to import my SBML instance into CellBlender?
* How to create a Lotka-Volterra simulation using our realistic geometry?
 
### Prerequisites
1. Galaxy ( 2 options)
   * Locally installed version of Galaxy ( https://github.com/murphygroup/cellorganizer-galaxy-tools) with Matlab R2018b
   * Access to the public server (http://galaxy3.compbio.cs.cmu.edu:9000)
2. Installed version of Blender with the CellBlender package (https://mcell.org/download.html)

## Generating SBML Instance from Pretrained SPHARM-RPDM Model on Galaxy

1. Log in on Galaxy
2. From the right panel (History panel) click on the “Gear icon”
3. From the drop down menu click on “Create a new history”
